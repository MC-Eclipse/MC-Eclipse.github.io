                <h1>Valley North Origins</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       Founded in 1985 by visionary horticulturist Jane Doe, 
                       Valley North Nursery began as a ten-acre plot in Arizona's
                       small town Cave Creek. Jane, who had spent years 
                       studying plant science and sustainable growing methods, 
                       dreamed of creating a place where high-quality, regionally 
                       adapted plants could flourish. With just a small propagation 
                       greenhouse, a handful of employees, and an unwavering 
                       passion for botany, she launched the nursery with an initial 
                       collection of cactus, succulents, and shrubs. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As the nursery grew through the 1990s, it became a warm and 
                        welcoming place for local families and garden lovers. Jane 
                        filled the grounds with new varieties of plants, colorful art, 
                        and friendly staff who were always happy to help newcomers pick 
                        the right plants. Weeknight classes such as Scouts learning and 
                        hands-on planting days became community favorites, drawing 
                        visitors who enjoyed learning simple gardening tips and 
                        spending time together outdoors.

                       Over the decades, Valley North Nursery has blossomed into 
                       a beloved community institution, expanding its offerings to 
                       include a diverse array of plants suited for desert and 
                       drought-tolerant landscaping. Today, the nursery features an 
                       extensive selection of native plants, ornamental trees, and 
                       garden accessories. Despite its growth, Valley North remains 
                       committed to Jane's original vision of promoting community 
                       gardening practices and providing exceptional customer service 
                       to gardeners of all experience levels.
